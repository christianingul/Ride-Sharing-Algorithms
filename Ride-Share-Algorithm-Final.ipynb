    "<hr style=\"border:10px solid black\">\n",

    "<font size=\"+1\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "Uber's value proposition is centered around customer satisfaction and trust, and as a business, it should be interested in increasing both and maximizing its profits. An article from Buildfire describes that according to Xtify, a company owned by IBM, push notifications open rates are as high as 60% and interaction rates up to 40%. Given a large number of Uber Eats customers, approximately 81 million in 2022, push notifications can significantly increase app engagement. Further, push notifications should be prioritized compared to conventional marketing strategies such as email marketing, which only has an open rate of 20% and an interaction rate of roughly 5%. Uber's motivation for implementing push notifications can be attributed to the high open rates and engagement rates, alerting a large customer base of new deals, discounts, and products through their app. Ultimately, more conversions could lead to higher revenues. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<font size=\"+1\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, Uber Eats push notifications were implemented in March 2020. With its large customer base, the tally of notifications amounted to several billion per month towards the end of 2020. Due to a large number of notifications, it was a new feature; a few core quality issues were described.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"There were core quality issues (i.e., notifications sent after hours, invalid deeplinks, duplicates, invalid promo codes, landing users on closed stores, etc.)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Notifications were being sent within minutes and hours of each other, many with conflicting messaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"Pushes were being sent to users with little to no personalization in terms of what push the user would prefer to receive, at what time, or at what frequency our marketing teams had introduced a variety of new methods to manually control conflicting messaging, adding upwards of 15 hours per week per team member and shifting valuable strategy work to more menial orchestration tasks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems described above affect customer trust, satisfaction, and engagement and can decrease potential revenues. Overall, reducing the effectiveness of push notifications, and if handled slowly, it could escalate to a situation where it will be difficult to gain back customer trust. As mentioned above, Uber's value proposition can be defined as a mix between customer satisfaction and trust. Therefore, there is an interest in exploring how we can use prescriptive analytics to tackle those problems mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To first assess a solution to the problems, a few critical decisions need to be made:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Time horizon: Under the simulated data, there will be a fixed time horizon composed of four different time slots with unique values for each push notification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Amount of notifications: In this problem, we are working with a fixed amount of push notification option and we can only send four notifications in total, and one for each time stamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The objective: Maximize the probability of customer conversion, which will be represented as the sum of the selected timestamp values. In other words, what is the schedule that maximizes the sum of scores from its assignments?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Output: This schedule should give us the optimal selection per time stamp and is limited to one push notification per time stamp and a total sum of 4."

We can use machine learning to predict the probability that a customer converts after being sent a push notification during a specific time bassed on historical data. The output in the form of a score will be assigned to each push notification per timestamp. From experience using logistic regression or a decision tree models are effective for this type of prediction. In order to create an effective model a few key data and assumptions would be necessary:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Customer preferences need to stay stable over time. If we see a lot of changes in Uber Eats food preferences it would be difficult to keep a model relevant.\n",
    "    \n",
